HAEWON: Who is she to say that?

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.730
LILY: I guess she's really not okay with sharing the president spot

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.570
HAEWON: Hey even if someone had complaints, it should be me

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:16.800
HAEWON: Why would she complain?

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.700
